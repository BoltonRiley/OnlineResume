  <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Introduction</h2>
  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Whilst working at Marvel Stadium I was introduced to Power BI when a member of our finance team requested a better report for our sales data. From learning the basics of visualisations on the desktop application to writing complicated ETL pipelines in the online service and creating realationships and stunning visuals to provide a completed product. I found this opportunity opened my eyes to data manipulation in general and I have since built a PostgreSQL server as part of a POC for a live dashboard of the stadium. We plan to utilise Databricks and Tableau to bring this to life at an enterprise level, pending approval from our leadership team.</p>

<section data-ai id="The Build" class="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 py-12">
  <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">The Build</h2>
  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">The build process involved creating a data model in Power BI Desktop, connecting to the source data, and building visualizations. I also developed ETL pipelines using Power Query to transform and clean the data before loading it into the model. The final dashboard was designed to be interactive and user-friendly, allowing stakeholders to explore the sales data reactively, diving into particular areas of interest as they saw fit.</p>

  <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Maintenance and Usage</h2>
  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">The dashboard is maintained mostly by myself with some input from other teams to identify additional data through excel sheets they update as part of their normal processes. It is used by stakeholders to monitor trends and changes in environment. The dashboard is updated on a weekly basis with the latest sales data, I have provided training sessions to ensure all users are comfortable with the interface.</p>
