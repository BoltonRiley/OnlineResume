  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">I studied business at RMIT in my teanage years whilst working at a cafe in the botanical gardens. Both of these experiences helped me bring to life my first business as a sole trader "Choo Brew Coffee". Landing a small kiosk on top of Essendon Station where I operated for a year before selling my project for a profit, searching for something bigger.</p>

  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">My partner was concerned that in moving overseas, she may find it hard to gain employment initially and so I stepped up to create an opportunity for her. I had spent the last 4 years working casually at coffee shop in the Royal Botanical Gardens whilst I studied business. Having recently gone through barista training, and seeing the succes of another small business popping up in Surrey Hills, I scoped out locations where a similar opportunity might be found. <br>
    Eventually I found a small kiosk space on top of Essendon Train Station that was available for lease. After negotiating a 12 month lease with an option for 2 more years and a further 2, I set about designing the kiosk space, organising equipment as well as finding a resedential rental property around the corner to live in whilst operating the business.<br>
    This initial phase took around 3 months of planning and preparation with over a month of back and forth with Cushman and Wakefield to secure the lease agreement. I was fortunate with Coffex, a local coffee roaster who provided me with a coffee machine on lease, as long as I was buying beans in bulk. I also sourced a cash drawer and connected a Square POS system to take card payments.<br>
    Finally I designed the menu, created social media accounts and organised signage for the kiosk before launching in early November 2019.
