    <p><strong>France</strong> — I can speak enough French to hold a simple conversation, but I visited mostly with my family before I was old enough to fully appreciate this beautiful country. I remember the amazing food, running beside the Tour de France, and the glorious warmth of the summer sun.</p>

    <p><strong>China</strong> — My parents took my brother and me to see the Terracotta Warriors and the Great Wall of China, which were truly spectacular.</p>

    <p><strong>Fiji</strong> — As a kid I loved Fiji until we left the relaxing beaches of the resorts. Visiting smaller towns opened my eyes to the privilege I had.</p>

    <p><strong>Samoa</strong> — The blowholes, sliding rocks, and beaches were great fun. More importantly, the locals were incredibly happy. I had a blast losing at rugby against some of the boys we met.</p>

    <p><strong>New Zealand</strong> — My first solo trip. After turning 18, I took the bus to Queenstown, hiked Ben Lomond, and went bungee jumping.</p>

    <p><strong>Cambodia</strong> — I may be biased as this is where I met my wife and lived for six months, but Koh Rong Sanloem is heaven on earth. Skip Sihanoukville—transfer through quickly.</p>

    <p><strong>Russia</strong> — I eloped here. Incredible infrastructure and people. Saint Petersburg offered the best meat I’ve ever eaten, and Murmansk delivered the northern lights.</p>

    <p><strong>South Africa</strong> — Johannesburg was rough, but the vineyards outside Cape Town were stunning. Alto Rouge quickly became a favourite.</p>

    <p><strong>Indonesia (Bali)</strong> — Twist in Ubud serves some of the best food I’ve ever had. Riding dirt bikes through volcanic craters was unforgettable.</p>

    <p><strong>Tonga</strong> — A walking tour of a GMO company was incredibly insightful. Pangaimotu Island and Big Mama Yacht Club were highlights.</p>

    <p><strong>Peru</strong> — We hiked the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu during an Intrepid trip, with unforgettable stops along the way.</p>

    <p><strong>Ecuador (Galápagos)</strong> — A lifelong dream. Giant tortoises, blue-footed boobies, sea lions everywhere. Absolutely magical.</p>

    <p><strong>Turkey</strong> — Istanbul was busy, but Cappadocia at sunrise watching hot air balloons was unforgettable.</p>

    <p><strong>Georgia</strong> — The food here is to die for.</p>
