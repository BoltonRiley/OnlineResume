  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Whilst working at Marvel Stadium I was introduced to Power BI as a tool by a member of our finance team requesting better methods of extracting data from our POS environment. From learning the basics of visualisations on the desktop to writing complicated ETL pipelines and creating visuals to accompany them. I found this opportunity opened my eyes to data manipulation in general and I have since built a PostgreSQL server as part of a POC for a live dashboard of the stadium. We plan to utilise Databricks and Tableau to bring this to life at an enterprise level, pending approval from our leadership team.</p>
