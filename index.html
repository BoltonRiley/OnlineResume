  <div id="detail-powerbi" class="detail-section hidden">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Power BI Project</h2>
    <p>While working at Marvel Stadium, I was introduced to Power BI when our finance team asked for a more effective way to report on sales data. What began with learning basic visualisations quickly grew into building complex ETL pipelines, creating relational data models, and designing polished dashboards. This experience opened my eyes to the broader world of data manipulation, and it inspired me to build a PostgreSQL server to provide a more robust back end for this project.</p>
    <p>To build the dashboard, I created a structured Power BI data model, connected it to the source systems, and transformed the data using Power Query. I then designed interactive visuals that allowed stakeholders to explore sales trends in depth. I continue to maintain the dashboard myself, working with other teams as they provide additional data through their regular Excel processes. I’ve delivered training sessions to ensure everyone feels confident using it.</p>

  <div id="detail-website" class="detail-section hidden">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Web Application Development</h2>
    <p>Building this website has been a fun project to develop my skills outside of work. I built it from scratch, purchasing the domain and learnt the languages HTML and JS to produce the page. I initially hosted the site on my home device, but eventually caved and moved it to a Github page. Tailwind adds the styling framework, whilst Cloudflare is used to provide the DNS and workers. I also use Open AI's gpt-4.0-mini LLM to generate user responses based on the content in the rest of the website.</p>

  <div id="detail-coffee" class="detail-section hidden">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Business</h2>
    <p>Whilst completing my Business Degree at RMIT, I wanted to start a small business. I settled on a coffee shop, as it was something I understood. The price to enter is low if you start on a smaller scale and there is always a market.</p>
    <p>I set up my sole trader ABN and leased a space on Essendon Station as a convenient location for workers to grab a coffee on their way to work. I sourced a coffee machine and beans from a local supplier and eventually had a staff member assist me when I was studying or couldn't opperate the shop myself.</p>
    <p>Eventually I sold the business as I didn't see a long term vision in the space, but made a solid profit and have kept the lessons and the ABN tucked away in case I decide to start a new venture down the line.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="detail-pos" class="detail-section hidden">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Efficiencies</h2>
    <p>I led several POS improvements focused on reliability, efficiency, and scalability. These included implementing automated restart handling through Windows Task Manager to ensure updates and application recovery occurred correctly, and introducing consistent naming conventions across POS terminals, locations, and keyboards to improve searchability and ongoing maintenance. I also replaced paper-based communications with Microsoft Sway, giving casual staff easy access to SOPs, event details, and operational updates.</p>
    <p>In addition, I helped roll out kiosks, self-order, self-checkout POS systems, and autonomous outlets to improve checkout speed and reduce labour requirements. A major improvement was the development of an automated POS health-check system that performed comprehensive pre-event diagnostics and delivered reports automatically. This reduced pre-event checks from up to five staff over several hours to two staff for one hour, lowering operational overheads while allowing skilled staff to focus on higher-value technical work.</p>
  </div>

  </div>
    <div id="detail-sports" class="detail-section hidden">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Sports</h2>
    <p>I've always enjoyed sports and staying active. I was competitive in cross-country running and rowing through highschool, but have also tried my hand at footsall and tennis as well as playing basketball since primary school.</p>
    <p>More recently I have joined a second team and have been enjoying going to the gym regularly. I strongly believe that fitness is part of a healthy lifestyle and enjoy the energy I feel from keeping active.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="detail-travel" class="detail-section hidden">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Travel</h2>
    <p>I’ve been fortunate to travel widely with both family and independently, experiencing a diverse range of cultures and landscapes. Early trips to France, China (including the Great Wall and Terracotta Warriors), Fiji, and Samoa sparked an appreciation for history, food, and cultural difference, while also offering early perspective on global privilege. As I grew older, travel became more independent and adventurous, from a solo trip to Queenstown, New Zealand—hiking Ben Lomond and bungee jumping—to living in Cambodia, where Koh Rong Sanloem remains one of my favourite places in the world.</p>
    <p>More recent travel has focused on immersive, experience-driven adventures, including hiking the Inka Trail to Machu Picchu in Peru, exploring the wildlife of the Galápagos Islands in Ecuador, and eloping in Russia, with highlights such as Saint Petersburg and seeing the northern lights in Murmansk. Other memorable experiences include vineyards near Cape Town, volcano riding in Ubud, Bali, sunrise hot air balloons in Cappadocia, Turkey, standout food in Tbilisi, Georgia, coastal exploration in Cyprus, and snowboarding in Hakuba, Japan. Across all destinations, I’ve been most drawn to meaningful local experiences, food, nature, and shared cultural moments.</p>
    <p>I am currently trying to learn Russian, and have an intermediate knowledge of French.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="detail-games" class="detail-section hidden">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Games</h2>
    <p>I’ve always been drawn to problem-solving, which naturally led to a long-standing interest in video games, board games, and interactive experiences. This interest has extended beyond playing into creating experiences for others, such as designing and hosting multi-stage murder mystery events for friends and family. The events combined logic puzzles, physical activities, and narrative elements—including clues, red herrings, and themed challenges. They were successfully run multiple times for different groups with slight customisations for different numbers and experiences.</p>
    <p>This curiosity for how things work also carries into technology and game development. After selling my first business, Choo Brew Coffee, I reactivated my ABN in 2024 to start Density Games, where I began developing my own video games. Alongside this, I enjoy both modern and classic board games such as Terraforming Mars, Heat, 500, and Settlers of Catan. I also enjoy hands-on technical projects, from experimenting with basic electronics to building and upgrading my own PC.</p>
